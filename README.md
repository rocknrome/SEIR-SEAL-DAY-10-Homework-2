desktop mockup

For today's morning exercise, you're tasked with recreating the mockup above of a flower shop's site.

Set Up
In today's morning_exercise directory, we've provided you with a flowerbox directory. Work in there.
Make sure you're inside the flowerbox directory then touch index.html styles.css files.
Open the directory in Visual Studio Code
Add boiler plate HTML to your index.html
Connect your styles.css and index.html together
Open index.html in your browser
We've provided you with all necessary images inside the imgs folder
So get started!
Getting Started
It's up to you how you want to tackle this mockup, but remember a few concepts we talked about in the past:

Wireframing: Consider wireframing the mockup so you have a better understanding of how you'll want to lay out your element tree and so forth.
Start with HTML first: Consider laying out your HTML before even touching your CSS file so you know the parent-children relationships / what element belongs to what / what classes or what elements you used, which should make styling and flexing things a bit easier!
Otherwise, though, have at it! Just recreate it the way you feel best.

Resources
While the main focus here is for you to get the positioning correct, if you want to match everything exactly here are the fonts/colors that were used in the mockup!
